The [Terraform Driver](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/drivers/generic-drivers/terraform/) can be configured to execute the Terraform scripts as part of a Kubernetes Job execution in a target Kubernetes cluster, instead of in the Humanitec infrastructure. In this case, you must supply access data to the cluster to the Humanitec Platform Orchestrator. 

The examples in this section show how to provide those data by referencing a `k8s-cluster` Resource Definition as part of the [non-secret](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/drivers/generic-drivers/terraform/#runner-object) and [secret](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/drivers/generic-drivers/terraform/#runner-object-1) fields of the `runner` object in the `s3` Resource Definition based on the Terraform Driver.

* [k8s-cluster-refs.tf](k8s-cluster-refs.tf): provides a connection to an [EKS cluster](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/drivers/k8-drivers/eks-cluster/).
* [s3-ext-runner-refs.tf](s3-ext-runner-refs.tf): uses [runner](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/drivers/generic-drivers/terraform/#running-the-terraform-runner-in-a-target-cluster) configuration to run the Terraform Runner in the external cluster specified by [k8s-cluster-refs.tf](k8s-cluster-refs.tf) and provision an S3 bucket. It configures the Runner to run Terraform scripts from a private Git repository which initializes a [Terraform s3 backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3) via Environment Variables.
