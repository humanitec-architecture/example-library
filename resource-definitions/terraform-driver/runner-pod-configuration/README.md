The [Terraform Driver](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/drivers/generic-drivers/terraform/) can be configured to execute the Terraform scripts as part of a Kubernetes Job execution in a target Kubernetes cluster, instead of in the Humanitec infrastructure. In this case, you must supply access data to the cluster to the Humanitec Platform Orchestrator. 

The examples in this section show how to provide those data by referencing a `k8s-cluster` Resource Definition as part of the [non-secret](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/drivers/generic-drivers/terraform/#runner-object) and [secret](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/drivers/generic-drivers/terraform/#runner-object-1) fields of the `runner` object in the `azure-blob-account` Resource Definition based on the Terraform Driver.
They also provide an example of how to apply labels to the Runner Pod and make it able to run with an [Azure Workload Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview?tabs=dotnet#service-account-labels-and-annotations) getting rid of the need of explicitly setting Azure credentials in the Resource Definition or using a Driver Account.

* [k8s-cluster-refs.tf](k8s-cluster-refs.tf): provides a connection to an [AKS cluster](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/drivers/k8-drivers/aks-cluster/).
* [azure-blob-account.tf](azure-bloc-account.tf): uses [runner](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/drivers/generic-drivers/terraform/#running-the-terraform-runner-in-a-target-cluster) configuration to run the Terraform Runner in the external cluster specified by [k8s-cluster-refs.tf](k8s-cluster-refs.tf) and provision an [azure blob account](https://developer.humanitec.com/platform-orchestrator/reference/resource-types/#azure-blob-account). It configures the Runner to run Terraform scripts from a private Git repository where an [Terraform azurerm backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/azurerm). Neither a driver account or secret credentials are used here as the runner pod is configured to run with a workload identity associated to the specify service account via `runner.runner_pod_template` property.
