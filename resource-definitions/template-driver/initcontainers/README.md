This section contains example Resource Definitions using the [Template Driver](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/drivers/generic-drivers/template/) for defining an [init container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/) on your Pods.

* [`custom-workload-with-initcontainer.yaml`](./custom-workload-with-initcontainer.yaml): Add the required init container to the Workload so it polls for the existence of a Kubernetes service for the Workload. This format is for use with the [Humanitec CLI](https://developer.humanitec.com/platform-orchestrator/cli/).
* [`custom-workload-with-initcontainer.tf`](./custom-workload-with-initcontainer.tf):  This format is for use with the [Humanitec Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/humanitec/humanitec).
