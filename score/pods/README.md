You can set any property of the [Kubernetes PodSpec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#PodSpec), except `containers`, through a Score extension file for your workload.

Refer to the [Pod feature](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/workload-profiles/features/#humanitecpod) for configuration details.
