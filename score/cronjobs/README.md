Define your workload to be deployed as a [Kubernetes CronJob](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/Workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/) through a Score extension file.

The extension file needs to request a Workload Profile which creates a CronJob, such as the built-in [default-cronjob](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/workload-profiles/built-in-workload-profiles/#default-cronjob) Workload Profile.

The CronJob schedules are defined in the `spec.schedules` section of the extension file. Refer to the [schedules feature](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/workload-profiles/features/#humanitecschedules) for configuration details.

You may optionally also set additional properties for the Kubernetes `CronJob`, `Job`, and `Pod` objects which will be created. Refer to the [CronJob feature](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/workload-profiles/features/#humaniteccronjob), [Job feature](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/workload-profiles/features/#humanitecjob), and [Pod feature](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/workload-profiles/features/#humanitecpod) descriptions for details on supported properties.
