Define your workload to be deployed as a [Kubernetes Job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/Workloads/controllers/job/) through a Score extension file.

The extension file needs to request a Workload Profile which creates a Job, such as the built-in [default-job](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/workload-profiles/built-in-workload-profiles/#default-job) Workload Profile.

You may optionally also set additional properties for the Kubernetes `Job` and `Pod` objects which will be created. Refer to the [Job feature](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/workload-profiles/features/#humanitecjob) and [Pod feature](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/workload-profiles/features/#humanitecpod) descriptions for details on supported properties.
