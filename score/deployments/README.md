For a Workload that is deployed as a Kubernetes `Deployment`, you can set properties of the [Kubernetes DeploymentSpec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/deployment-v1/#Deployment) on the Kubernetes `Deployment` object through a Score extension file for your workload.

Refer to the [Deployment feature](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/workload-profiles/features/#humanitecdeployment) for details on supported properties.
